# Charge-Up: sample for android
This is a sample application for our app “charge-up”
# About charge-up
we started ideation of this app when we heard from our seniors that they usually miss classes due to long queues, distance between two classes and short time gaps between classes
Let's take an example we have to go to from class A to class B which we can say is 15 mins far and we have a mess in mid 10 mins away , idealy we have to reach mess place an order then wait but what if u place ur order when u start moving from class A and when you reach the mess your food is prepared and you can "Charge-Up" for the day
